**Location Actions Alignment**: National Action Plan on Climate Change

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[**2.2.6. Clean Air Initiatives**]

In urban areas, one of the **major sources of air pollution is emissions from transport vehicles**. Steps taken to reduce such pollution include:

* (i) introduction of compressed natural gas (CNG) in Delhi and other cities; 

* (ii) retiring old, polluting vehicles;

* (iii) **strengthening of mass transportation as mentioned above**. 

Some state governments provide subsidies for purchase and use of electric vehicles. For thermal power plants, the installation of electrostatic precipitators is mandatory. In many cities, polluting industrial units have either been closed or shifted from residential areas.

.panel[.panel-name[**4.3. National Mission on Sustainable Habitat**]

A National Mission on Sustainable Habitat will be launched to make habitat sustainable through **improvements in energy efficiency in buildings**, management of solid waste and **modal shift to public transport**. 

(i). **The Energy Conservation Building Code**, which addresses the design of new and large commercial buildings to optimize their energy demand, will be extended in its application and incentives provided for retooling existing building stock.

(iii). **Better urban planning and modal shift to public transport**. Making long term transport plans will facilitate the growth of medium and small cities in ways that ensure efficient and convenient public transport.

## Proposal - Key Question
.pull-left[
#### Why do you need to develop a project when already have a relevant testing platform?

1. Currently, there are two largest air quality monitoring platforms (**AirAQI & AQI-IN**) in the world with a global audience and no focus on India.

2. Few data samples (17 in Mumbai's main urban areas).

3. Detection method is mainly based on sensors.

3. Limitations of sensors: "Regional Coverage?" "Who Buy?" "Damaged?" "Maintenance?" "Mobile monitoring?"

# Part 2 – 3 Technical Workflow

---
## Technical Workflow – Data Drive Action

#### How to predict the air quality index selected by the user?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Figure/Figure Part 2-2/img/technical_workflow.png')
```

---

## Technical Workflow – Data preparation stage 1

#### Three types of data

*1.* Air pollution data (air quality index)

Source: AQI `r Citep(myBib,"AQI2022")`, CPCB (Indian official data) `r Citep(myBib,"CPCB2024")`,
Sentinel 5 (TROPOMI provided)

| Variable | Units | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| $O_{3}, PM2.5, SO_{2}, CO, NO_{2}$ | $\mu g / m^{3}$ | As the dependent variable, will be predicted |

---

## Technical Workflow – Data preparation stage 2

*2.* Meteorological data

Source: AQI `r Citep(myBib,"AQI2022")`, India Meteorological Department `r Citep(myBib,"IndiaMeteorologicalDepartment2021")`

Effect: Related studies `r Citep(myBib,"Liu2007", "Zhang2018")` show that meteorological variables can affect air quality

| Variable | Units | 
|----------|-------|
| Temperature | Degrees celsius |
| Relative humidity | Percentage |
| Solar radiation | $W/m^{2}$ |
| Wind speed | $m/s$ |
| Precipitation| Mm |
| Wind direction | Degrees |
| Pressure | $Mb$ |

---

## Technical Workflow – Data preparation stage 3

*3.* Remote sensing data

Landsat-8 data (high spatial resolution: 30m, many spectral bands: 11 bands)

| Variable | Units | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Band 1-7 | Surface reflectance | Add more independent variables; Used to calculate other variables |
| NDVI, SAVI, EVI | - | Vegetation index is related to air quality `r Citep(myBib,"Jia2014a", "Zhang2016a")` |
| LST | Degrees celsius | Related studies have also considered LST as a potential influencing factor `r Citep(myBib,"Chen2014")` |

Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), land surface temperature (LST)

---

## Technical Workflow – Modelling stage

#### Predict air quality index using land use regression (LUR) models

Four machine learning techniques: 
multiple linear regression (MLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), 
support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR)

Model building process:

- Select independent variables (user select)
  
- Select dependent variables, using Bayesian information criteria (BIC) or variance inflation factor (VIF)
  
- Determine metrics (RMSE: root mean square error (RMSE), $R^{2}$: coeffcient of determination)
  
- Divide the dataset into train, validation and test set
  
- Spatial cross-validation (prevent spatial autocorrelation)
  
- Train and test the four models, and choose a better model
  
- Execute prediction

Source: `r Citep(myBib,"Alvarez-Mendoza2019", "Lopez2023")`

---

## Technical Workflow – Visualization stage

#### How to present the prediction results of the air quality index to the user?

- Using geographic information system (GIS) technology, prediction results can be displayed on a real-time interactive map

- Users can choose to view different air quality index through different layers on the map

- Specific technical approaches include the use of the Google Maps API, open source libraries (Leaflet, ECharts), and so on

# Summary
The Mumbai government has already shown a significant commitment to addressing air pollution by implementing relevant policies and establishing the AQI monitoring platform. However, the current platform relies on `sensor data`, which poses `limitations in coverage` and incurs `high costs` due to the `restricted number of sensors`. Therefore, our project proposes an atmospheric pollution monitoring platform based on remote sensing data.

Advantages of our Platform:

* Combining remote sensing data with sensor data to `expand the effective monitoring range`.
* Collaborating with the local AQI platform to `reduce monitoring costs`.
* Contributing to `environmental assessments` and the `formulation of related policies`.
* Enhancing Mumbai's `international reputation` in the field of environmental protection.
