## Policies: Local Actions II

*Location Actions Alignment: National Action Plan on Climate Change

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[**2.2.6. Clean Air Initiatives**]

In urban areas, one of the **major sources of air pollution is emissions from transport vehicles**. Steps taken to reduce such pollution include:

* (i) introduction of compressed natural gas (CNG) in Delhi and other cities; 

* (ii) retiring old, polluting vehicles;

* (iii) **strengthening of mass transportation as mentioned above**. 

Some state governments provide subsidies for purchase and use of electric vehicles. For thermal power plants, the installation of electrostatic precipitators is mandatory. In many cities, polluting industrial units have either been closed or shifted from residential areas.

]
]

.panel[.panel-name[**4.3. National Mission on Sustainable Habitat**]

A National Mission on Sustainable Habitat will be launched to make habitat sustainable through **improvements in energy efficiency in buildings**, management of solid waste and **modal shift to public transport**. 

(i). **The Energy Conservation Building Code**, which addresses the design of new and large commercial buildings to optimize their energy demand, will be extended in its application and incentives provided for retooling existing building stock.

(iii). **Better urban planning and modal shift to public transport**. Making long term transport plans will facilitate the growth of medium and small cities in ways that ensure efficient and convenient public transport.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/technical_workflow.png')
```

---

# Data preparation stage

### Three sources

*1.* Air pollution data (air quality indicators)

Source: AQI, monitoring station

| Variable | Units | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| $O_{3}, PM2.5, SO_{2}, CO, NO_{2}$ | $\mu g / m^{3}$ | As the dependent variable, will be predicted |

---

# Data preparation stage 2

*2.* Meteorological data 

Source: AQI, monitoring station

Effect: Related studies `r Citep(myBib,"Liu2007", "Zhang2018")` show that meteorological variables can affect air quality

| Variable | Units | 
|----------|-------|
| Temperature | Degrees celsius |
| Relative humidity | Percentage |
| Solar radiation | $W/m^{2}$ |
| Wind speed | $m/s$ |
| Precipitation|$Mm$ |
| Wind direction | Degrees |
| Pressure | $Mb$ |

---

# Data preparation stage 3

*3.* Remote sensing data

Landsat-8 data

| Variable | Units | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Band 1-7 | Surface reflectance | Used to calculate other variables |
| NDVI, SAVI, EVI | - | Vegetation is also related to air quality `r Citep(myBib,"Jia2014a", "Zhang2016a")` |
| LST | Degrees celsius | Related studies have also considered LST as a potential influencing factor `r Citep(myBib,"Chen2014")` |

Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), land surface temperature (LST)

---

# Modelling stage

#### Predict air quality indicators using land use regression (LUR) models

Four machine learning techniques: 
multiple linear regression (MLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), 
support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR)

Model building process:

- Select independent variables (user select )
  
- Select dependent variables, using Bayesian information criteria (BIC) 
  
- Determine metrics (RMSE, $R^{2}$)
  
- Divide the dataset into train, validation and test set, 
  
- Spatial cross-validation
  
- Train and test the four models, and choose a better model
  
- Execute prediction

Source: `r Citep(myBib,"Alvarez-Mendoza2019", "Lopez2023")`

# Visualization stage

#### What is presented to the user is an interactive map

Using geographical information from remote sensing data, prediction results can be displayed on an interactive map in real time.

Similar visualization:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/visual_result.gif')
```
