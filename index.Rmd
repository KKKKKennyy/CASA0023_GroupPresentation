# Policies: Global Agendas

·**Global Agendas Alignment**: UNFCCC Article 4, New Urban Agenda (65, 75, 79), and SDGs (3, 11, 13).

| **United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change** | **New Urban Agenda**     | **SDGs**    |
|:----------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------:|:-------:|
| Chapter 4 Commitment                                 | ...                  | ...     |
| (b) Formulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change **by addressing anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks** of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, and measures to facilitate **adequate adaptation** to climate change                | 65. We commit ourselves to facilitating the sustainable management of natural resources in **cities and human settlements** in a manner that **protects and improves the urban ecosystem** and environmental services, **reduces greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution** and promotes disaster risk reduction and management, by supporting the development of disaster risk reduction strategies and periodical assessments of disaster risk caused by natural and human-made hazards, including standards for risk levels, while **fostering sustainable economic development and protecting the well-being and quality of life of all persons** through environmentally sound urban and territorial planning, infrastructure and basic services.     | **Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages**: Health and population: **reduce the number of deaths and illnesses from hazardous chemicals and pollution**. |
| (c) Promote and cooperate in the development, application and diffusion, including transfer, of technologies, practices and processes that **control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases** not controlled by the Montreal Protocol in all relevant sectors, including the *energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry and waste management sectors*    | 75. We commit ourselves to encouraging national, subnational and local governments, as appropriate, to **develop sustainable, renewable and affordable energy and energy-efficient buildings and construction modes** and to promoting energy conservation and efficiency, which are essential to enable the **reduction of greenhouse gas** and black carbon emissions, ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns, help create new decent jobs, **improve public health** and reduce the costs of energy supply.  | Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable: The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) provided multiple anchor points for **sustainable transport**, in the context of infrastructure, public transport systems, goods delivery networks, affordability, efficiency and convenience of transportation, as well as **improving urban air quality and health**, and **reduce greenhouse gas emissions**.  |
| (d) **Promote sustainable management**, and promote and cooperate in the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of **sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases** not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, including biomass, forests and oceans as well as *other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems*; | 79. We commit ourselves to promoting international, national, subnational and local climate action, including **climate change adaptation and mitigation**, and to supporting the efforts of cities and human settlements, their inhabitants and all local stakeholders as important implementers. We further commit ourselves to **supporting building resilience and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases** from all relevant sectors. Such measures should be consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, including holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre- industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. | Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, through paragraph 31 “calls for the widest possible international cooperation aimed at **accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions** and addressing adaptation to the adverse impacts of climate change”. |

# How to predict the air quality index selected by the user

### The technical workflow behind the APP

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/technical_workflow.png')
```

---

# Data preparation stage

### Three sources

*1.* Air pollution data (air quality indicators) 

Source: AQI, monitoring station

| Variable | Units | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| $O_{3}, PM2.5, SO_{2}, CO, NO_{2}$ | $\mu g / m^{3}$ | As the dependent variable, will be predicted |

---

# Data preparation stage 2

*2.* Meteorological data 

Source: AQI, monitoring station

Effect:

- Related studies show that meteorological variables can affect air quality

- Provide more potentially influential variables

| Variable | Units | 
|----------|-------|
| Temperature | Degrees celsius |
| Relative humidity | Percentage |
| Solar radiation | $W/m^{2}$ |
| Wind speed | $m/s$ |
| Precipitation|$Mm$ |
| Wind direction | Degrees |
| Pressure | $Mb$ |

---

# Data preparation stage 3

*3.* Remote sensing data

Landsat-8 data

| Variable | Units | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Band 1-7 | Surface reflectance | Sunlight directly affects air quality |
| NDVI, SAVI, EVI | - | Vegetation is also related to air quality |
| LST | Degrees celsius | Related studies have also considered LST as a potential influencing factor |

normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI)

soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI)

enhanced vegetation index (EVI)

land surface temperature (LST)

---

# Modelling stage

#### Predict air quality indicators using land use regression (LUR) models

  Four machine learning techniques:

multiple linear regression (MLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), 
support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR)
  

  Model building process:

  - Select independent variables (user select )
  
  - Select dependent variables, using Bayesian information criteria (BIC) 
  
  - Determine metrics (RMSE, $R^{2}$)
  
  - Divide the dataset into train, validation and test set, 
  
  - Spatial cross-validation
  
  - Train and test the four models, and choose a better model
  
  - Execute prediction

---

# Visualization stage

### What is presented to the user is an interactive map

Using geographical information from remote sensing data, prediction results can be displayed on an interactive map in real time.

Similar visualization:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='60%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/visual_result.gif')
```
